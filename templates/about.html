          <p>
            NaFake is a Fake News Detection platform. It's model is built with
            the Passive Aggressive Classifier Machine Learning algorithm. <br />
            You can use the detector in any of these ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>

          <h4>Motivation</h4>
          <p>
            The Faculty of Engineering and Technology of the
            <a class="ub" href="https://www.ubuea.cm/" target="_blank"
              >University of Buea
            </a>
            assigned this project to me as my Final Year project in Partial
            Fulfillment of a B. Eng Degree in Computer (Software) Engineering.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2016, during the United States election, a lot of fake news
            websites were created, and shared through social media, especially
            on Facebook. They were so much so that, Fake News had more clicks
            than the real ones.
          </p>

          <p>
            One of the most iconic cases were from a citzen from Macedonia who
            had over 100 fake news websites, and earned thousands of dollars
            with advertising.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most of those websites were pro-Trump, why? Was the macedonian a
            true Trump defender? Not necessarily! But he noticed that Trump
            voters were more likely to believe and propagate Fake News.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Fake News Detector is an initiative to make some difference in
            the fight against this problem - joining your effort (Crowdsourcing)
            with technology (Machine Learning).
