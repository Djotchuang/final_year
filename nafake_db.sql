So it was a campaign for greater political and civil rights, and the separatists were seen as very marginal. But the government intervened in a heavy-handed way and that stirred support for the militants,\" Francophone Africa analyst at the UK-based Chatham House think-tank, Paul Melly, told the BBC.\n\nLocals say this happened in many areas, including the farming town of Bafut, where soldiers were accused of carrying out random attacks, even torching the motorcycle taxis of young men.\n\n\'Classic rural insurgency\'\n\nWith their source of income destroyed, the taxi operators made the town a no-go area for the government by forming the Seven Karta militia - \"karta\" refers to a famous cloth worn by people in the area and \"seven\" to a group of men who, legend has it, were known for their strength during the colonial era.\n\nRights group Amnesty International said the militants have also committed atrocities.\n\nApart from killing members of the security forces, they have also carried out attacks \"designed to strike fear amongst the population, going as far as burning down schools and targeting teachers who did not enforce the boycott\", Amnesty said in a report.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Cameroon\'s descent towards civil war\n\nThe International Crisis Group (ICG) think-tank estimates that around 10 armed separatist groups exist, gaining control of a \"significant proportion of rural areas and main roads\" in the North-West and South-West regions.\n\n\"They are not operating under one broad front, but there is very likely to be co-ordination between political elements in exile,\" ICG Cameroon analyst Richard Moncrieff told the BBC.\n\n\"They are waging a classic rural insurgency. They don\'t control territory all the time. They move around. They use hit-and-run tactics against isolated units of the security forces or prestigious targets - like local chiefs, whom they kidnap,\" Mr Moncrieff told the BBC.\n\nMr Okereke said he believed that the Ambazonia Self-Defence Council (ASDC), which is also known as the Ambazonia Restoration Forces (ARF), is the largest armed group, incorporating smaller militias like the Seven Karta, the Red Dragons and the Tigers.\n\nCameroon - still divided along colonial lines:\n\nImage copyright Alamy Image caption Africa\'s borders were \"carved up\" up by colonial powers\n\nColonised by Germany in 1884\n\nBritish and French troops force Germans to leave in 1916\n\nCameroon is split three years later - 80% goes to the French and 20% to the British\n\nFrench-run Cameroon becomes independent in 1960\n\nFollowing a referendum, the (British) Southern Cameroons join Cameroon, while Northern Cameroons join English-speaking Nigeria\n\nRead more: Cameroon timeline\n\nBut the monitoring group, Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (Acled), said on its website that the ADF is the most active militia.\n\nThe ADF launched operations in 2017 in the Manyu district in the South-West and Mezam in the North-West, before shifting its focus to six other districts, the monitoring group said.\n\nAfrican mythology\n\nThe ADF and other militia have clashed with government forces 83 times this year, compared with 13 times last year, Acled added.\n\n\"Many of the regions where Ambazonian separatists are newly active are in North-West Cameroon. This expansion does not necessarily suggest that any one militia that comprises the Ambazonian separatists is expanding its operations; the spread could be the result of new groups forming in the North-West,\" it said.\n\nThe armed separatists have also established a strong presence on social media, with the Red Dragons posting videos of its fighters, including women, in gumboots and uniforms in a bush, and showing what they say was the shooting down of a military helicopter.\n\nCritics dismiss the videos as propaganda and say the group has suffered heavy setbacks at the hands of government forces.\n\nThe militias rely heavily on imagery of animals, as well as African mythology, to rally support.\n\n\"You must know a tiger to become a Tiger,\" the Tiger group said on its website.\n\n\"It is believed that some of the Tigers are the ghosts of dead ancestors who have risen from the grave to defend their people,\" it added.\n\nThe name Ambazonia comes from Ambas Bay, the area of a settlement of freed slaves which is regarded as the boundary between Anglophone and Francophone Cameroon.\n\n\'Desertions from army\'\n\nA phrase often heard among the fighters as they appeal to their supporters, inside and outside the country, for funding is: \"We need to buy sugar cane and ground nuts.\"\n\nIt is a euphemism - sugar cane refers to guns and ground nuts to bullets.\n\nRead more about Cameroon:\n\nMany of the Amba Boys, as the separatist fighters are colloquially known, are armed with hunting rifles, though more sophisticated weapons, like Kalashnikovs, are said to have been seized from government forces while ammunition is being smuggled in from neighbouring Nigeria, according to some analysts.\n\nMore significantly, the ranks of the militias are also being swelled by some English-speaking deserters from the Cameroonian army, the ICG said.\n\n\"The security apparatus is under pressure, as evidenced by the proliferation of military desertions in the English-speaking area, some 20 of them even joined armed separatist groups,\" the ICG said.\n\nAgreeing with the ICG, Mr Okereke said some government officials, including governors and mayors, fled their posts or failed to take up new appointments after the conflict started.\n\n\"Biya thought he could overrun the separatists, but the government is under immense pressure from them,\" he added.\n\n\'No serious dialogue\'\n\nWhile the army has been unable to defeat the separatists, they in turn are unable to win a military campaign, Mr Moncrieff said.\n\n\"They do not have sufficient international support and military strength to defeat the army,\" he added.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption About 175 Cameroonian soldiers and police officers have been killed during the insurgency, the ICG says\n\nThe conflict has, in the past year, claimed the lives of at least 420 civilians, 175 military and police officers, and hundreds of separatist fighters. More than 300,000 people have also been forced to flee their homes, according to the ICG.\n\nMr Melly said the conflict was mainly between the armed separatists and the government.\n\n\"This is not an inter-communal war between two nations who hate each other. People move back and forth all the time between the Anglophone and Francophone regions, and many of the people fleeing the conflict are going to Francophone areas. If there is political will, a solution can be found,\" he added.\n\nFor now, there is no sign of that. The armed separatists have vowed to enforce a boycott of Sunday\'s election, raising fears of attacks on polling stations and a low turn-out in mainly Anglophone areas.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption President Paul Biya is seen by his critics as an autocrat\n\nMr Biya is likely to win the poll, as he has \"absolute control over the security forces, and the electoral body\", Mr Moncrieff said.\n\nThe key question is whether he will offer an olive branch to the separatists after the poll.\n\n\"So far, his strategy has been to keep multiplying troops,\" Mr Moncrieff said.\n\n\"There has been no serious attempt to advance dialogue. He\'ll need to do that. The overwhelming majority of Anglophone Cameroonians have genuine grievances, and feel they are treated like second-class citizens.\"', 'Real', 'https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-45723211', 1),

In Cameroon, health officials have begun dispatching healthcare workers to find hep B patients who are avoiding treatment and getting the vaccine for their newborns.\r\n\r\nFarmer Valerie Mbappe, 52, said she was diagnosed with hepatitis in April.\r\n\r\nBut she was reluctant to go to a doctor because her uncle told her she should be treated by a traditional healer.\r\n\r\nAfter going to the healer, Mbappe’s abdominal pain, fatigue and fever have gotten worse.\r\n\r\nShe said now that she knows that she can be treated at the hospital, her advice is that people should not be reluctant to visit health facilities for their hepatitis screening.  She said she was told by the nurse that she should stop drinking and smoking heavily because it may lead to complications during her treatment.\r\n\r\nMbappe was brought to the General Hospital in Yaoundé by members of SOS Hepatitis, a charity group that helps patients seek treatment.\r\n\r\nSpokesman for the group Samuel Yamissi said the efforts are part of this year’s World Hepatitis Day activities, marked annually on July 28.\r\n\r\nHe said their main target is the majority of patients who refuse to go to hospitals and prefer traditional treatments.\r\n\r\nEveryone who tests positive for hepatitis can get help from his group and the government, said Yamissi.  He said those who test negative will be given their first dose of the hepatitis vaccine. People who take the first dose of the vaccine should come for the second dose after three months and the last dose after six months, said Yamissi, to be free of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn 2019 Cameroon reported 12,000 new cases of hepatitis B, up from 9,600 in 2018.\r\n\r\nBut Cameroon’s Ministry of Health says 13 percent of people are living with hepatitis B in the country of 25 million.\r\n\r\nDespite the high rate of infection, the ministry says less than 1,500 Cameroonians are receiving treatment.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Health’s Dr. Simon Eyong treats hepatitis B patients.\r\n\r\nHe said to encourage patients to go to hospitals, the government reduced the cost of treatment from $250 per month to less than $50.\r\n\r\n\"Since it is a slow killer disease, which symptoms only appear when it has already reached its climax, get tested, get vaccinated.  Keep away from unprescribed medications like anti-inflammatories like Paracetamol,\" said Eyong.\r\n\r\nCameroon’s 360 government hospitals this year for the first-time dispatched health workers to track patients and ensure they get their treatments and vaccines.\r\n\r\nThe health ministry’s Dr. Abdoulaye Sajo said the government also targets birth dose hepatitis vaccines for newborns.\r\n\r\nHe spoke via telephone from the northern town of Garoua.\r\n\r\nSajo said the government has given firm instructions that all newly born babies, all mothers, and all pregnant women should be screened and vaccinated against hepatitis B. He said the government has also given instructions that everyone tested positive should be treated immediately.  The only challenge they have, said Sajo, is meeting the so many mothers who never visit hospitals and prefer to deliver at home.\r\n\r\nOnly 35 percent of Cameroon’s 25 million people visit hospitals.\r\n\r\nOthers rely on traditional healers and only go to hospitals when their health becomes critical.', 'Real', NULL, 1),
(3, 'Cameroon Citizens Raised $40M for COVID Relief, But Where is It?', 'YAOUNDE - Cameroon has bowed to pressure from rights groups and ordered investigations into the management of the COVID-19 solidarity fund contributed to by civilians. The rights groups said most of the $40 million cash and material had been embezzled. An outcry was sparked after rights groups said 4,000 bags of rice donated to COVID-19 patients were illegally sold.\r\n\r\nAbout two dozen people are this Monday morning at the Messassi government hospital in Cameroon’s capital Yaounde for consultations. Among them is 27-year- old Ernestine Sahmo who is visiting for her weekly diabetes control. Sahmo says she and other patients are surprised at the absence of COVID-19 prevention kits at the hospital. \r\n \r\n\"Most of the time you go there and there is no water. You just find a bucket being placed there without any water in it and at times too you don’t even meet soap,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe hospital officials declined to comment on the absence of soap to wash hands. But the government of Cameroon said enough thermometers, soap, disinfectants, hand sanitizers, face masks, medicines and sufficient quantities of water were distributed all over the country. \r\n \r\nThe government said it used money contributed to a COVID-19 solidarity fund to buy the COVID kits. Cameroon president Paul Biya contribited $ 1.8 million to the fund. \r\n \r\nOther contributions were received from civilians, companies, minister, lawmakers and senior sate functionaries.    \r\n \r\nCameroon also received assistance to fight COVID-19 from foreign governments. The central African state said it received $226 million in emergency funding from the International Monetary Fund. \r\n \r\nOther people contributed food with a local company handing to the government huge quantities of rice. \r\n \r\nApande Fadimatou of the NGO “Health fo All” says the government should give an account of how much it received and how much it spent. Fadimatou says some of the medicines the government claims it purchased have not been seen. She says she believes some money, food and nonfood items have been diverted. \r\n\r\nShe says she is surprised that even for the sake of governance and to respect Cameroon public management principles, an audit has not been conducted on the COVID-19 solidarity fund ordered by Cameroon president Paul Biya. She says the government should give the right information to civilians if it ordered the 4,000 bags of rice weighing 50 kilograms each and some COVID-19 protective materials donated by the people to be sold because it needed money to buy COVID-19 rapid test kits as some people claim. \r\n\r\nCameroon health minister Manaouda Malachie says neither the funds nor the goods had been diverted. \r\n\r\nHe says the ministry of health with the ministries of territorial administration, finance and trade made sure food items were distributed to all hospitals with COVID-19 patients. He says some food was given to Cameroon’s 10 regional governors to distribute to families and communities hardest hit by COVID-19.\r\n\r\nManaouda says face masks, hand sanitizers, soap and buckets were shared to civilians, and protective kits for hospital staff members distributed in hospitals. He says independent control teams and solicitors were invited to follow up the process and render accounts in case there is need.  \r\n\r\nManouda said the government had spent more than $40 million from the fund and from government contributions since March when the first case of COVID-19 was reported. He did not state how much has been contributed. \r\n \r\nManouda said following requests by rights groups and civilians, Cameroon prime minister Joseph Dion Ngute has ordered an investigation into how the funds and material were used. \r\n \r\nIn July, Human Rights Watch asked Cameroon to disburse funds to support health care facilities responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate any missing funds.', 'Real', NULL, 1),
(4, 'Cameroon: Journalist Accused of Secessionism Detained for Six Months', 'The Cameroonian authorities have yet to provide a credible explanation for the death in detention of journalist Samuel Wazizi in August last year and Reporters Without Borders now condemns the detention of another English-speaking journalist, also accused of supporting pro-secessionists in English-speaking regions of the country.\r\n\r\nIs Cameroon turning into Central Africa\'s most dangerous country for journalists? President Paul Biya has promised an investigation into the disturbing circumstances surrounding the death in military custody of journalist Samuel Wazizi. The death was acknowledged by the authorities 10 months after it occurred. Now the treatment of a second English-speaking journalist, freelance Kingsley Fumunyuy Njoka, is giving cause for concern. He was arrested at his home in Douala, the country\'s economic capital, by four armed men on 15 May. His wife told RSF that three laptop computers were seized at the same time.\r\n\r\nHe was held incommunicado for three weeks before lawyers were allowed to see him. He was officially accused of secessionism and collusion with an armed group, and placed in provisional detention for six months on 12 June. According to one of his lawyers contacted by RSF, he is in a \"feverish state\" and his arrest is linked to his criticism of the way the Cameroonian authorities have handled the crisis in the English-speaking regions in the west of the country, plagued by fighting between troops and armed separatists which has caused 3,000 deaths in three years. He is also alleged to belong to social media discussions groups on the Anglophone crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nA close colleague of the journalist contacted by RSF described the allegations as \"ridiculous\". According to reports received by the organization, Njoka is known for his professionalism and his criticism of the authorities\' handling of the crisis, while harsh at times, is always factually based. According to those close to him, he was probably being monitored because he regularly discussed the conflict with other journalists.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\"The allegations against this journalist have yet to be substantiated and his detention incommunicado for several weeks would doubtless have been longer were it not for the serious revelations about the death of his English-speaking colleague Samuel Wazizi, who was also arrested for his coverage of the crisis in western Cameroon,\" said Arnaud Froger, the head of RSF\'s Africa desk. \"It is a serious cause for concern that Cameroonian journalists such as those who report on the Anglophone conflict are held incommunicado, routinely linked with terrorists and tried by special courts. No country in the region has gone this far in recent years in cracking down on freedom of news and information.\"\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Kingsley Njoka is a sad reminder of the fate of his English-speaking colleague Samuel Wazizi. In its investigation, RSF was able to confirm that Wazizi, also accused of colluding with secessionists, died in detention, that his family was not informed of his death contrary to what the government stated, and that the wounds on his body showed further investigation was warranted to establish the exact circumstances of his death. According to the official version, he died as a result of illness just two weeks after his arrest, despite being in perfect health.\r\n\r\nThe arbitrary detention of journalists, sometimes for long periods, are common in Cameroon. Ahmed Abba, Radio France Internationale\'s Hausa-language correspondent, was accused of terrorism in a case that was a total fabrication. He spent 29 months in detention before he was released in 2017 and forced to leave the country.\r\n\r\nAmadou Vamoulké, the former head of Cameroon\'s state radio and TV broadcaster CRTV, is still held in provisional detention after nearly four years. Accused of misusing state funds, he is on trial before a special court that has held more than 30 hearings yet has failed to draw up charges against him. RSF referred his case to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which ruled that his detention had \"no legal basis\" and called for his release. It said his right to a fair trial had been seriously violated.\r\n\r\nCameroon has fallen three places to 134th in the 2020 World Press Freedom Index compiled by RSF.', 'Real', NULL, 2);
